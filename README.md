            My name is Ross, I am currently a Computer Science student at the University of South Wales and hopefully on track to becoming a software developer.
            I have been interested in computing since a young age and would develop a keen interest into how they function both mechanically and through their use of software,
            however a more recent interest of mine is quantum computing as it is such a rich and interesting field that combines the studies of computing, mathematics and quantum mechanics,
            which are three subjects I am heavily interested in.
            <br><br>
            My interest in quantum computing developed after reading and watching various content on the subject, and found myself with a fascination on how such small objects like electrons and photons
            can have such a big impact on computation int the form of qubits which unlike classical computers which can only represent itslef as 1's and 0's, these qubits can be put in a state of superposition
            which means they can represent 1 and 0 simultaneously allowing for an enhanced level of parallel programming.
