            My name is Ross, I am currently a Computer Science student at the University of South Wales and hopefully on track to becoming a software developer.
            I have been interested in computing since a young age and would develop a keen interest into how they function both mechanically and through their use of software,
            however a more recent interest of mine is quantum computing as it is such a rich and interesting field that combines the studies of computing, mathematics and quantum mechanics,
            which are three subjects I am heavily interested in.
            <br><br>
            My interest in quantum computing developed after reading and watching various content on the subject, and found myself with a fascination on how such small objects like electrons and photons
            can have such a big impact on computation in the form of qubits which unlike classical computers, which can only represent itslef as 1's and 0's, these qubits can be put in a state of superposition
            which means they can represent 1 and 0 simultaneously allowing for more complex and enhanced levels ofcomputation.

            Currently working towards a Bachelors degree in Computer Science.
            <br></br>
            I am also designing a website for personal use that I will be able to use as a resume for future job applications.
            <br></br>
            In addition, I am also studying for some CyberSecurity Certifications as they will be useful in further developing my understanding of secure systems and software.

                <li>Football âš½ - I have been playing football since I could walk and have captained a team for roughly 9 years, I enjoy football as it is a highly social game which can either be the most serious activity you ever do or can just be a laugh with friends and no two games are ever the same.</li>
                <br></br>
                <li>Golf â›³ - I like to play golf as it is very relaxing activity and is highly skill based which provides an enjoyable challenge.</li>
                <br></br>
                <li>Pool/Snooker ðŸŽ± - These are probably my favourite activity on this list as these combine the need for a high skill level and quick stregic thinking, as outsmarting your opponent and causing                                    them to make mistakes can be more rewarding than potting the balls.</li>
                <br></br>
                <li>Video Games ðŸŽ® - They're fun ðŸ˜„</li>
